# Goal

Attached is a simple Node.js web app with 2 files
1. package.json
2. server.js

Create a Dockerfile and the relevant file(s) so we could build the docker image.

# Criteria

1. From the 2 supplied files, create a Dockerfile and relevant instructions so we could run build and run the docker image.


# Acceptance Criteria

1. An image from the Dockerfile could be built and executed 
2. The Dockerfile is documented and easy to follow

# Bonus Points

- extra steps to productionise the image eg image tagging/ versioning
- Adapting stronger Security Practices
- Multistage build
